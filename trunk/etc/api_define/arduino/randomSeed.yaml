description: 'randomSeed() initializes the pseudo-random number generator, causing
  it to start at an arbitrary point in its random sequence. This sequence, while very
  long, and random, is always the same.


  If it is important for a sequence of values generated by random() to differ, on
  subsequent executions of a sketch, use randomSeed() to initialize the random number
  generator with a fairly random input, such as analogRead() on an unconnected pin.


  Conversely, it can occasionally be useful to use pseudo-random sequences that repeat
  exactly. This can be accomplished by calling randomSeed() with a fixed number, before
  starting the random sequence.'
example: "long randNumber;\n\nvoid setup(){\n  Serial.begin(9600);\n  randomSeed(analogRead(0));\n\
  }\n\nvoid loop(){\n  randNumber = random(300);\n  Serial.println(randNumber);\n\n\
  \  delay(50);\n}\n"
