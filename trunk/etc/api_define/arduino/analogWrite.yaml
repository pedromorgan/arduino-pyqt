description: 'Writes an analog value (PWM wave) to a pin. Can be used to light a LED
  at varying brightnesses or drive a motor at various speeds. After a call to analogWrite(),
  the pin will generate a steady square wave of the specified duty cycle until the
  next call to analogWrite() (or a call to digitalRead() or digitalWrite() on the
  same pin). The frequency of the PWM signal is approximately 490 Hz.


  On newer Arduino boards (including the Mini and BT) with the ATmega168 chip, this
  function works on pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. Older USB and serial Arduino boards
  with an ATmega8 only support analogWrite() on pins 9, 10, and 11.

example: "Notes and Known Issues\n\nanalogWrite has nothing whatsoever to do with\
  \ the analog pins or analogRead.\n\nYou do not need to call pinMode() to set the\
  \ pin as an output before calling analogWrite().\n\nThe PWM outputs generated on\
  \ pins 5 and 6 will have higher-than-expected duty cycles. This is because of interactions\
  \ with the millis() and delay() functions, which share the same internal timer used\
  \ to generate those PWM outputs. This will be noticed mostly on low duty-cycle settings\
  \ (e.g 0 - 10) and may result in analogWrite(x, 0) not fully turning off the output\
  \ on pins 5 & 6, as one would expect.\n\nExample\n\nSets the output to the LED proportional\
  \ to the value read from the potentiometer.\n\n \nint ledPin = 9;      // LED connected\
  \ to digital pin 9\nint analogPin = 3;   // potentiometer connected to analog pin\
  \ 3\nint val = 0;         // variable to store the read value\n\nvoid setup()\n\
  {\n  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);   // sets the pin as output\n}\n\nvoid loop()\n{\n\
  \  val = analogRead(analogPin);   // read the input pin\n  analogWrite(ledPin, val\
  \ / 4);  // analogRead values go from 0 to 1023, analogWrite values from 0 to 255\n\
