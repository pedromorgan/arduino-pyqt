Attempt at a pyqt interface for arduino

Work in progress on a new Arduino interface with the Qt toolkit.

Work in progress
* Loads files into scincilla
* list pde files
* shows help

todo
* compile
* upload






=========================================
With a view to later using this as a base for a proper c++ version

Some simple suggestions
* add nice comments
* use Qt objects instead of python, eg QString - this will make porting to c++ easier
* test QSintilla http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/static/Docs/QScintilla2/classQsciScintilla.html


Dev Notes
icons.ico contains a list of icon names
icons.icon where Icon() is template eg Icon(Ico.Save)

the main window is passeed arround to each widget as main. so self.main in each classQsciScintilla
There is one settings() - this is created as self.main.settings.*
