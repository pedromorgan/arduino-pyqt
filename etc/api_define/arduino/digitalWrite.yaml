description: 'Write a HIGH or a LOW value to a digital pin. If the pin has been configured
  as an OUPUT with pinMode(), its voltage will be set to the corresponding value:
  5V (or 3.3V on 3.3V boards) for HIGH, 0V (ground) for LOW.


  If the pin is configured as an INPUT, writing a HIGH value will enable an internal
  20K pullup resistor (see the tutorial on digital pins). Writing LOW will disable
  the pullup.

  '
example: "int ledPin = 13;                 // LED connected to digital pin 13\n\n\
  void setup()\n{\n    pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);      // sets the digital pin as output\n\
  }\n\nvoid loop()\n{\n    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);   // sets the LED on\n    delay(1000);\
  \                  // waits for a second\n    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);    // sets\
  \ the LED off\n    delay(1000);                  // waits for a second\n}\n\nSets\
  \ pin 13 to HIGH, makes a one-second-long delay, and sets the pin back to LOW.\n"
