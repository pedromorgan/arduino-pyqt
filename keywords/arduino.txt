abs(x) Computes the absolute value of a number
analogRead(pinNo) The number of the analog input pin to read from (0 to 5 on most boards, 0 to 7 on the Mini and Nano)
analogReference(type) reference voltage used for analog input DEFAULT INTERNAL EXTERNAL
analogWrite(pinNo,value) writes an analog value (PWM wave) to pin
beginSerial(speed) initializes the serial port, should be called in setup()
bit(n) Computes value of specified bit (bit 0 is 1, bit 1 is 2, bit 2 is 4, etc.)
bitClear(x,n) Clears (writes a 0 to) a bit of a numeric variable
bitRead(x,n) Reads a bit of a number. x: the number from which to read. n: which bit to read, starting at 0 for the leastsignificant (rightmost) bit
delay(ms) Pauses the program for the amount of time in miliseconds specified as parameter. There are 1000 milliseconds in a second.
digitalRead(pin)  reads value from pin as HIGH or LOW
digitalWrite(pinNo, value) Write HIGH or LOW value to digital pin. If pin as OUPUT, voltage will be set to the corresponding value: 5V or 3.3V  HIGH, 0V (ground) for LOW.
max(x,y) Calculates the maximum of two numbers of any data type, the largest of either 
pinMode(pin, mode) specify pin to INPUT or OUTPUT
Serial.begin(speed) sets the data rate in bits per second (baud) for serial transmission
